# Weather Monitor App

Welcome and thank you for joining us in this exciting journey! Our Mobile App is all about making climate data analysis accessible.

## General observations

* This is our first-ever Mobile App, designed as a project for an ITCR course.
* Perhaps the design may not be the best, as previously mentioned, this project marked our first experience in designing this type of application. Also, we faced a tight deadline.
* This application utilizes data collected by an [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) over a one-week time lapse, and the analysis is based on that week's data.
* The information is stored in [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/?hl=es-419), and we have the capability to store additional data to enable more complex analyses.
* Please note that the database is currently not working. If you want to set up your own, please ensure that you have enabled a 'google-services' file for this project
